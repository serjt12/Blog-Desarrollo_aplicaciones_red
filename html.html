                        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
                        <p class="post-text">The full form of HTML is Hypertext Markup Language. It is a markup language that is used to create web pages. HTML is a subset of the XHTML language, which is used to create XML documents that are valid and well-formed.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You can think of HTML as the skeleton, structure, or layout of a web page. Everything on a webpage is built using components of HTML.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The smallest unit of HTML is called a tag. A tag is a piece of code that tells the browser how to display a certain part of the page. For example, the &#60;h1&#62; tag tells the browser to display the text inside the tag as a heading.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="post-text">The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in December 1999.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. XML is a standard markup language that is used to create other markup languages. Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML (Geography Markup Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication). Since each of these languages was written in a common language (XML), their content can easily be shared across applications. This makes XML potentially very powerful, and it's no surprise that the W3C would create an XML version of HTML (again, called XHTML). XHTML became an official standard in 2000, and was updated in 2002. XHTML is very similar to HTML, but has stricter rules. Strict rules are necessary for all XML languages, because without it, interoperability between applications would be impossible.
