                        <p class="post-text">JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in 1995. Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript as a scripting language for use with the company's flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator. Initially known as LiveScript, Netscape changed the name to JavaScript so they could position it as a companion for the Java language, a product of their partner, Sun Microsystems. Apart from some superficial syntactic similarities, though, JavaScript is in no way related to the Java programming language.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After its release, more and more browsers started adding JavaScript support. Still, for much of its history JavaScript was not regarded as a serious programming language. Its earliest releases suffered from notable performance and security issues, but developers had no alternatives. If they wanted to run programs in the browser, they had to use JavaScript.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In 2008, the creation of Google's open-source Chrome V8, a high-performance JavaScript engine, provided a crucial turning point for JavaScript. The subsequent proliferation of fast JavaScript engines made it possible for developers to build sophisticated browser-based applications with performance that competed with desktop and mobile applications.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Soon after, Ryan Dahl released an open-source, cross-platform environment called Node.js. It provided a way to run JavaScript code from outside a browser. It freed JavaScript from the browser's confines and led directly to JavaScript's current popularity. Today, you can use JavaScript to write all kinds of applications, including browser, server, mobile, and desktop applications. Most major online companies today, including Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, and Google, all use JavaScript in their products.</p>

                        <h3>JavaScript vs. Java</h3>

                        <p class="post-text">There’s often some confusion about the two, but JavaScript and Java have almost nothing in common. The name JavaScript came from Netscape’s support of Java applets within its browser. Many say it was also a marketing tactic to divert some attention from Java, which was the most buzzed-about language at the time. To run Java programs, the code must be first compiled into an executable form. On the other hand, JavaScript was created to be interpreted at run time, making it much more dynamic (these days the boundary of the two methods is a lot more blurred).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        JavaScript didn’t exactly get off to the best start. It didn’t perform as well, and those developing in Java considered JavaScript more of a “UI glue” to be used mostly by designers and other non-engineers. But the reality is that having a “glue” language allowed the internet to really flourish. Programmers could react better to use events and compose interactive components. And due to that, JavaScript spread like wildfire and very quickly became the lingua franca of the web.</p>
                        <h3>JavaScript's Future</h3>
                        <p class="post-text">JavaScript has come a long way since its original implementation: it took a mere 10 days to write it. The JavaScript standard, proposed for the first time as ECMAScript 1 in 1997, is, as of late 2018, in its 9th iteration (ES 2018). The differences between the specifications described in ECMAScript 1 and ES 2018 are immense: they seem to describe different languages. In the intervening years, JavaScript has undergone massive changes. Not everyone agreed with every change, but, taken together, they made JavaScript a more robust, secure, and expressive language.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The JavaScript community of today is arguably the most active community in programming. It sometimes seems that every week sees releases of new tools, frameworks, and libraries. There are preprocessors and transpilers of all sorts available, ranging from programs that translate modern JavaScript programs so older JavaScript engines can run them, to compiling entirely new languages with JavaScript. The JavaScript standard itself is a continuously evolving document, with improvements introduced at a rapid rate. JavaScript engines incorporate the changes almost as rapidly. New operating systems under development (e.g., Google's Fuchsia) are adding support for the development of native applications in JavaScript. All of this means that JavaScript has an exciting future. It's a great time to learn JavaScript!</p>
